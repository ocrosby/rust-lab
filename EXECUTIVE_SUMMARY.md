# Executive Summary: rust-lab Repository

**rust-lab** is a personal learning repository designed for exploring Rust programming fundamentals. The repository serves as a practical workspace for understanding core Rust concepts through hands-on coding examples.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains four separate Rust projects, each focusing on different programming concepts:

- **hello_cargo/** - Basic "Hello, world!" example demonstrating cargo project structure
- **variables/** - Explores Rust's variable immutability and mutability concepts  
- **functions/** - Demonstrates function definitions, parameters, and return values
- **branches/** - Implements conditional logic and control flow structures

## Key Learning Areas
The repository systematically covers fundamental Rust programming concepts:
- **Variables and Mutability** - Understanding Rust's default immutability and the `mut` keyword
- **Functions** - Function syntax, parameters, and return values
- **Control Flow** - Conditional statements and branching logic
- **Project Management** - Using Cargo for Rust project creation and management

## Technical Details
- All projects use **Rust 2024 edition**
- Each project is independently buildable with `cargo run`
- No external dependencies - focuses on core language features
- Includes practical examples that demonstrate compilation errors and their solutions

## Purpose
This repository functions as a structured learning path for Rust programming, providing practical examples that reinforce theoretical concepts through compilable code samples. It's particularly valuable for understanding Rust's unique approach to memory safety and variable mutability.
